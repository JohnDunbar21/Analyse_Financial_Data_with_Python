    "When describing the rate of return (ROI) of an investment, the time frame of the investment is an important consideration. It is commonplace to convert returns to a standard time period, i.e., converting to the annual rate of return - also known as **annualising**.\n",

    "If converting daily returns to annual returns, $t$ could be 252 as this is the number of trading days in a year. If converting monthly returns to annual returns, $t$ would be 12. This is expressed in Python below."
