    "The following code hopes to explore the relationship and risk involved in investing in Amazon or Ebay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through statistical analysis, it was found that:\n",
    "- Amazon's annual return is slightly higher than Ebay's annual return.\n",
    "- Amazon's variance for monthly returns was slightly higher than Ebay's, making it the riskier investment of the two.\n",
    "- Amazon's standard deviation was higher than Ebay's by around 2%, making investing in it much riskier: however, with the added benefit of having a higher annual return rate, it is up to the investor as to what their risk tolerance is.\n",
    "- There is a moderately strong correlation between Amazon and Ebay's monthly log rate or returns, this is suspected to be due to the fact that they operate within the same industry. It is ill advised to purchase shares in too many companies operating in the same industry, and investors are encouraged to diversify their investments in order to reduce risk of financial loss and fortify their investment portfolio."
